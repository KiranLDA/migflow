\title{Generate a random network}
\usage{
randomRIVER(nsites = 50, pop = 1e+05, toplot = TRUE, nbreeding = 8,
  minforks = 2, maxforks = 5, anadromous = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nsites}{number of sites to be generated in the network}

\item{pop}{population size flowing through network}

\item{toplot}{TRUE/FALSE to determine whether the output is plotted or not}

\item{nbreeding}{number of breeding sites. If all branch ends should be breeding sites then use "ALL"}

\item{minforks}{minimum number of forks in a river branch}

\item{maxforks}{maximum number of forks in a river branch}

\item{anadromous}{TRUE or FALSE. If TRUE, then population breeds at the tips of network branches, otheriwe, it breeding "at sea"}
}
\value{
a list containting the network which was randomly generated,
the tracks that were randomly generated, and the sites that were randomly generated for animals to use.
}
\description{
This function generates a random migratory network
