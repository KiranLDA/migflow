\arguments{
\item{nbreeding}{Number of breeding sites}

\item{nwintering}{Number of wintering sites}

\item{nstop}{Number of stopover sites (shared during north and south migration)}

\item{pop}{population size flowing through network}

\item{mean_dist}{average distance the species can travel (this can be estimated from real data)}

\item{sd_dist}{standard deviation of the distances a species can travel (this can be estimated from real data)}

\item{toplot}{TRUE/FALSE to determine whether the output is plotted or not}
}
\value{
a list containting the network which was randomly generated,
the tracks that were randomly generated, and the sites that were randomly generated for animals to use.
